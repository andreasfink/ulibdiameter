the syntax for packet definitions in the Diameter documents is as following

<>  indicates the AVP is in a fixed position and mandatory
{}  indicates the AVP is mandatory but can be in any position
[]  indicates the AVP is optional. They can be in any position
*   indicates minimum/maximum values
    if an optional AVP requires these values
    and precedes it  1 * indicates
    the number of times the element is present in the message
