 7.5.  Failed-AVP AVP

 The Failed-AVP AVP (AVP Code 279) is of type Grouped and provides
 debugging information in cases where a request is rejected or not
 fully processed due to erroneous information in a specific AVP.  The
 value of the Result-Code AVP will provide information on the reason
 for the Failed-AVP AVP.  A Diameter answer message SHOULD contain an
 instance of the Failed-AVP AVP that corresponds to the error
 indicated by the Result-Code AVP.  For practical purposes, this
 Failed-AVP would typically refer to the first AVP processing error
 that a Diameter node encounters.

 The possible reasons for this AVP are the presence of an improperly
 constructed AVP, an unsupported or unrecognized AVP, an invalid AVP
 value, the omission of a required AVP, the presence of an explicitly
 excluded AVP (see tables in Section 10) or the presence of two or
 more occurrences of an AVP that is restricted to 0, 1, or 0-1
 occurrences.

 A Diameter message SHOULD contain one Failed-AVP AVP, containing the
 entire AVP that could not be processed successfully.  If the failure
 reason is omission of a required AVP, an AVP with the missing AVP
 code, the missing Vendor-Id, and a zero-filled payload of the minimum
 required length for the omitted AVP will be added.  If the failure
 reason is an invalid AVP length where the reported length is less
 than the minimum AVP header length or greater than the reported
 message length, a copy of the offending AVP header and a zero-filled
 payload of the minimum required length SHOULD be added.

 In the case where the offending AVP is embedded within a Grouped AVP,
 the Failed-AVP MAY contain the grouped AVP, which in turn contains
 the single offending AVP.  The same method MAY be employed if the
 grouped AVP itself is embedded in yet another grouped AVP and so on.
 In this case, the Failed-AVP MAY contain the grouped AVP hierarchy up
 to the single offending AVP.  This enables the recipient to detect
 the location of the offending AVP when embedded in a group.
